########## RECENT CHANGE-LOG #########

  Note that we version STiki by the date (UTC locale) of the build-date. This
  is also the file-name under which the executable/source is released. The 
  formal version number (e.g., 2.1) is in too many places to be 
  conveniently altered for small changes:
  
  * 2013-XX-XX
      # The "user talk" link which appears in the "metadata" and "last 
        revert" panels has been modified so it is appropriately blue/red 
        based on the existence of that page. (T#034)
      # A new substitution, "#p#", is available for use when authoring 
        revert comments and AGF messages. This makes it possible to provide
        the "user whose version is being reverted to". (T#032) 
      # In lieu of the latest emergency release and the manual notification
        of the required upgrade, code has now been implemented to automate
        this in the future. Clients now make an explicit version check against
        the server, which will pop an informational dialogue and forced
        exit if the user's version is insufficient. (T#033)
      # The first user-facing "revision filter" has been installed in the
        "filter" menu. There, users can choose whether edits comittted by
        privileged users (i.e., sysops, reviewers, and rollbackers) should
        be displayed in the GUI. (T#029)
      # A bug whereby mnemonic usage could result in duplicate 
        classifications has been fixed. (T#030)
  
  * 2013-08-19
      # EMERGENCY RELEASE: The following security change by WMF developers:
        [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2013-August/071266.html]
        completely broke how login cookies are parsed in STiki (and most
        other applications, I have to imagine). This caused the edit/rollback
        tokens requested to be invalid under server checks, causing all
        edits to fail with a "badtoken" response. Every user will need
        to upgrade their STiki distribution.
      # Default revert comments were changed to note the quantity of edits
        reverted, with always correct plurality. This is done via the "#q#" 
        (quantity) and "#s#" placeholders (plurality switch) now interpreted
        by the "edit comment" panel.
  
  * 2013-05-23
      # Fixes to the AGF message dialogue (T#025). One can now abandon the
        revert action after the dialogue has been displayed, and checks
        ensure that the customized message will not be placed if the
        revert fails. Both edits (the revert and the message) commit 
        after the message has been authored. 
      # The AGF message dialogue has been updated with the modifications
        made by users at [[WP:STiki/Good-faith-revert_messages]]. Similarly,
        the number of user customizable messages has increased from 2 to 4.
      # The space bar is now disabled when the "classification panel" has 
        focus (most of the time). Previously, pressing spacebar would repeat 
        the previous classification action taken. However, this seemed to 
        cause far more accidents than intent-driven uses (T#026).
      # The "user talk" links in the interface (in the "metadata" and "last 
        revert" panels) now append the affected page title in a special format
        that makes welcoming/warning messages easier for Twinkle users.
        [[WT:STiki/Archive_11#Feature_Request:_Article_Reference_on_Talk_Pages]]
      # Minor changes to backend queuing, attempting to stop the CBNG
        queue from displaying edits made by STiki users.
      
  * 2013-01-26
      # When making an "AGF revert" classification, a dialog will now appear
        that allows users to post custom notifications/explanations to
        the offending user's talk page. This dialog can be disabled via
        the "options" menu.The dialog contains a text field in which any
        message can be authored, but more likely, user's will take advantage
        of the pre-written/template-esque options provided in a drop-down
        menu. There is also the capability to store custom messages 
        if an editor is so inclined. Overall, it is hoped this will result 
        in less [[WP:BITE]] behavior towards those being reverted (T#019).
      # The "edit properties" panel now displays the relevant "permissions"
        or "groups" which the editor under inspection has obtained. These
        are placed parenthetically next to the user name, and include:
        
          * "autoconf" -> autoconfirmed
          * "conf" -> confirmed
          * "review" -> reviewer
          * "rb" -> rollbacker
          * "admin" -> sysop
        
        If a registered user has none of these, then "no permissions" will
        be displayed. No information is displayed about IP editors (as they
        can have no such permissions) (T#022).
      # Minor organizational changes to the "edit properties" window to 
        bring greater prominence to the "summary" and "editor" fields, 
        since these are often vandalism indicators (T#024).
      # Users can now generate a "live" leaderboard for their own viewing
        purposes inside the tool, via "Rev. Queue" -> "Generate leaderboard".
        It is a slightly simplified version of the one at 
        [[WP:STiki/Leaderboard]], but should serve the edit-count-itis folks
        quite nicely until the nightly updates are made on the wiki (T#023).
      # A previous change prevented "null diffs" from being pointlessly 
        displayed to end users. That change essentially caused such RIDs
        to be ignored. This caused them to stay in the queue, often 
        accumulating and forcing the program to process (but re-skip them)
        at start-up. A fix now dequeues null diffs upon their discovery.
      # The "WikiTrust" and "Link Spam" queues have been disabled. The 
        former is dependent on third-party computation which has been broken
        for some time (and no one ever used the queue, anyways). The link
        spam queue isn't really used either, but that queue is computed on a 
        local machine. The primary reasoning for disabling it is cost. The
        classification model is dependent on queries to the Alexa API,
        which are not free, and we make many thousand monthly ($65+) (T#021). 
  
  * 2012-12-04
      # Zero difference edits (i.e., null diffs) where no changes are made
        will no longer be presented to users. These appeared in the transition
        to the diff browser displaying "rollback"-derived differences (whereas 
        server-side enqueuing works on the edit level) (T#016).
      # The location of the STiki server is no longer hard-coded. Instead,
        it is now represented at an HTTP location. This web server and its
        DNS routing are independently controlled; making this is a useful
        tool in migrating STiki to a new location (likely to happen with 
        my PhD completion and the job search). 
      # Because AGF edits cannot use native rollback (as they must not be 
        marked "minor), software rollback uses the "edit full text" 
        API call when 2+ edits must be reverted in this fashion. Unlike every 
        other edit path, this operation does not have an integrity checks
        that would cause the edit to fail if intermediate/conflicting edits
        had occured. This lack of check gave rise to a bug noticed by
        [[User:Yaris678]]; and now an explicit check has been added.
      # Minor update to a "revert panel" message: The "beaten to revert" case 
        only displays when an identity revert has taken place as a
        conflicting edit. Thus, if a non-identity change/conflict took 
        place while an edit was in the diff browser, the "last revert panel" 
        would say  "Undid 0 edits / unknown error / check page hist". This 
        message has now been corrected to say "conflict or error". 
      # Backend: IRC reporting of STiki scores now outputs a URL by
        which the diff for an RID can simply be opened in browser. 
      # Backend: Functionality added for "unification" of accounts. Imagine
        someone has a "public terminal" account and a primary account. It is
        now possible for all actions of either account to map to the primary
        one (primarily for leaderboard purposes). An edit "pass/ignored" in
        one account is similarly reflected in the other. This is achieved via
        [client_func_usermap.sql] in the [db_client] package and minor
        modifications to server-side stored procedures
  
  * 2012-07-18
      # A "recent usage statistics" option has been added to the "Queue" menu.
        This reports basic numbers about STiki/queue use over the last 1/6
        hours. As high rates of use can cause queue exhaustion and lower 
        hit-rates, users can interpret these statistics to determine how best 
        to allocate their STiki usage time and queue choice (T#014).
      # Minor changes to the "excessive pass use" and "don't template the
        regulars" message dialogues per discussion at [[Wikipedia_talk:STiki]].
      # The message displayed in the diff browser that indicates rollback
        situations (i.e., 2+ edits are encapsulated by the diff and would
        be reverted) has been revised per [[Wikipedia_talk:STiki]]
      # The default comment left with AGF reverts has been changed per
        a talk page request from "good faith revert..." to "reverting good 
        faith edit(s)..." Custom AGF messages will need to be re-authored.
    
  * 2012-06-03
      # Users must now meet qualification conditions in order to use STiki.
        A user must meet one of the following: (1) Have the rollback
        permission. (2) Have > 1000 article namespace edits. (3) Receive
        special permission from STiki administration (by asking on the
        talk page). Prior users will be grandfathered in and not subject
        to these criteria. While possibly turning away new users, this is
        a necessary step to prevent abuse and ensure classification accuracy.    
      # Given that "templating the regulars" [[WP:DTTR]] seems to be a
        primary source of reputation loss for STiki, it has now been addressed
        programatically. Per the "options" menu, a dialogue can be popped
        with an informative message, and an opportunity for re-inspection
        can occur when one is about to revert a "regular." Currently "regular"
        is defined as a registered editor with > 50 NS0 edits. (T#015).
      # Previously, the "overuse of the pass button" warning was popped to 
        users whenever they had 10 passes in a session. This is excessive
        for consistent users. Now, use of the pass button will be persistently
        tracked with long-term users seeing fewer/no warnings. This is 
        stored in the settings file and therefore will not be persistent 
        across different machines.
      # Thanks to hard work by [[User:Allens]], the external link processing
        capabilities have been vastly improved. For GUI users, this will
        manifest itself when the "Options"->"Activate Ext. Links" option
        is enabled. The quite tricky case where just *part* of a URL 
        changes is now handled correctly (T#009).
      # The {{Shared IP advice}} template is now appended to all IP user-page
        warnings; a message about creating an account to avoid DHCP issues.
      # MINOR: The persistent settings file now has refined permissions.
        Whereas the prior version just applied standard Java file permissions
        (and was world read-able). The file is now only read-writeable by
        the OS user that operates the STiki tool. No effect to end-user.
        
  * 2012-05-22
      # The "wiki-diff" link in the metadata panel wsa repaired so that it now 
        displays the same diff as in the diff-browser. This was an omission 
        in the GUI's switch to exclusively rollback functionality. (T#008)
      # Some (but not all) users reported that the different elements in 
        the "help menu" failed to jump to the appropriate section/anchors 
        in the help-doc. This has been fixed. Also, a related bug was 
        discovered/fixed where external links in the help document were 
        not being handled correctly (T#011).
      # The diff-browser now has copy-paste functionality. Text can be
        highlighted in the diff-browser and transferred to the clipboard
        either via CTRL+C or a right-click context menu (T#012).
      # It is now possible to enable HTTPS support via the "Options" menu.
        If checked, HTTPS will be used for all communication with the 
        MediaWiki API and any links that open in browser and point to 
        "wikipedia.org". A restart is required. (T#013).
          - Following from the above, the "Appearance" menu has been renamed 
            to "Options". This could soon become a larger bin for settings.
            Documentation changed accordingly.
          - Minor (invisible) changes were also made to the way that
            persistent settings are stored, so that the XML output remains
            clean and human-editable as STiki evolves.
      # Code has been put in place such that, if consensus is reached, that
        STiki can only be used by editors with the rollback permission. 
        This functionality is encoded but currently not in use (T#005).
      # If STiki is going to post a user-warning to a "User Talk" page 
        which is in fact a redirect, it now resolves that redirect (T#002).
      # Most are familiar with warning templates {uw-vandalism#} or {uw-spam#}.
        Less common are those like {uw-test#}, {uw-joke#}, or {uw-advert#}
        that also identify problematic users. The identification and
        escalation from these templates (into spam/vandalism ones) is now
        part of warning logic. Notably, STiki will not jump from a non-spam
        or non-vandalism level 4 warning to an AIV post (it will post a level 4 
        spam/vandalism instead), though it will do this for "4im" cases. 
        (this request was not bug-tracked; it was posted by [[User:Allens]]).
  
  * 2012-04-12
      Modifications in this version are primarily minor bug-fixes and
      feature requests following from the substantial release of 2012-4-11.
      This changelog will also contain ticket-numbers from requests, which
      are lodged at [[Wikipedia_talk:STiki]]:
      # The "activate hyperlinks" setting is now correctly read and 
        applied from the user configuration XML. (T#007)
      # Functionality has been added so the diff-browser can be scrolled using
        the keyboard. The keys are PG_UP and PG_DOWN (slight scrolling) or 
        UP_ARROW and DOWN_ARROW (more dramatic). The "classification" 
        panel must have focus for this functionality to work (i.e., in a
        state where pressing "v" would fire a "vandalism" revert). (T#001)
      # Good-faith reverts will no longer be marked as "minor" (as vandalism/
        spam edits are), per the policy of [[WP:Minor]]. Because native 
        RB cannot be marked "minor", good-faith reverts must use "standard" 
        editing calls to simulate rollback functionality (such "software 
        rollback" is more processor/bandwidth intensive than the "native" form).
  
  * 2012-04-11
      # Good-faith revert has been implemented and included as a fourth
        classification option. Good-faith reverts do not leave a warning
        or any message to the user talk page. The comment left with
        good-faith reverts is visible -- and can be adjusted -- via the
        (newly!) tabbed comment panel. 
      # The notion of "rollback" is now fully integrated. Simple reverts are
        no longer supported. All presses of "vandalism", "spam", or
        "good faith revert" will initiate a rollback action (we implement this
        in software for those that don't have the native permission). 
        To this end, the diff browser now displays all edits that will be 
        undone (in a single diff). If more than one edit could be rolled-back, 
        this is noted beneath the article title in the diff browser, in purple.
      # Settings are now *persistent* between STiki sessions. This includes
        all user-modifiable elements (e.g., checkboxes, form fields, window
        size/position) in the program. Queue selection is not persistent; this 
        remains server-set so users can be steered away from queues that are 
        offline or experiencing difficulty. Configuration is stored in XML
        format in the user's home directory. Special thanks to 
        [[User:Meiskam]] of en.wp for help with this.
      # Logic added so that CBNG queue does not enqeue edits made by bots,
        per a request and some issues raised at [[WP:STiki]]. Note that
        the "metadata" and "anti-spam" queues already do this.
      # Documentation changed to reflect above modifications
  
  * 2012-03-12
      # Minor bug-fix. The [java.awt.desktop] package is used to open Java
        hyperlinks in a user's default web browser. The package is not 
        universally supported, and in particular a Java 1.5 user on OS X
        reported that STiki would not start as a result of this dependency.
        To this end, a new "link opener" class has been installed that 
        hacks around this functionality.
      # Additional tweaking for Java 1.5 compliance, since it seems the
        compiler [target] option is insufficient in this sense. This
        included re-pathing some JDBC CommunicationException and shifting from
        unsupported [setIconImages()] to [setIconImage()].
  
  * 2012-01-17
      # To STiki itself, some debugging output was added to help track the
        "badtoken" error thhat [User:Peter_Chastain] keeps receiving when
        his rollbacks ocassionally fail. Normal users shouldn't care.
      # The WikiAudit tool [WP:WikiAudit] is included starting with this 
        release. It is a program orthogonal to STiki, but convenient to
        include here because of the shared code-base:
        # WikiAudit takes as input a set of IP addresses.
        # It ouputs a report detailing the contributions from those
          IP addresses. Low-cost heuristics are used to identify malicous
          behaviors at the per-user and per-revision levels. 
        # We envision this being useful for institutional/organizational
          network administrators who want to monitor constituent behavior.
  
  * 2012-12-29
      # Some changes were made to the "last revert panel":
        # The panel now contains a link to the "article", so one can now
          easily visit the page which was just affected by an undo/RB.        
        # Previously, the "0 edits undone... beaten to revert? ... check
          page hist" message was displayed anytime an edit attempt did not
          succeed. Now, there are separate messages for the "beaten to revert" 
          (which is known to be the outcome) and "error" cases. They display 
          in bold-red for prominence.
          # If an "error" edit outcome occurs, and the user has started STiki
            from the command-prompt/terminal, there should be output about
            the error. Please post this to the talk-page, so we can
            discover which error conditions are occuring in practice.
          # A small GUI error was fixed where the panel would report that an 
            edit was successfully made, when in fact, the STiki user had 
            been beaten to the revert. This was a result of the MW-API
            returning a "success" code, but unknowingly also noting "nochange".
            This only affected a minority of users without native rollback.
      # Backend: Even when CBNG scores itself poorly; these edits will never be
        enqueued. i.e., a CBNG revert will never be popped from the CBNG queue. 
      # Backend: A script has been included in the [/utilities] directory such
        that one can de-queue any edit that has 'x+' pass actions, in order
        to increase the efficiency of other editors and aim for broader
        coverage. Debating whether to use on the main en-wiki project itself.
   
  * 2011-12-02
      # Users may have noticed that in-line diff changes were no longer
        being highlighted red. This seemed to be an unannounced change when
        WP migrated to 1.17 or 1.18. Bring these things to my attention!
      # Bot edits no longer enqueued by backend
      # Bug found in diff-parsing: A change in "<span class="name">"
        styling in DIFFs returned by the API caused our parsing attempts
        to ocassionally (once per hour, maybe) enter an infinite loop.
        This was the source of many thread-life/utilization issues. 
  
  * 2011-08-01:
      # Changed user warning revision summary to be less agressive.
      # Minor efficiency improvements. Primarily, lengthy string
        concatenations now make use of the StringBuilder class.
  
  * 2011-06-21:
      # STiki now contains an "anti-link-spam" queue. Every link addition
        to en.wiki is cored for its "spam likelihood" using: (1) Wikipedia
        metadata, (2) Destination processing (fetching the HTML landing site),
        and (3) Third-party data (Alexa, Google Safe Browsing project).
        This caused considerable additions throughout the project:
          # When the spam queue is selected: (1) external links will become
            click-able in the diff-browser, (2) the GUI classification buttons
            and revision comment will adjust accordingly, and (3) "spam"
            warnings will be issued to UserTalk pages when requested. 
          # Source code can be obtained at [WP:STiki]. Although the projects
            share a code-base, it is being separated from the STiki core
            until stability is verified and for load distribution purposes.
          # Formal version number of STiki increased to 2.0.
          # See the documentation or [WP:STiki] for additional details.
      # Better handling of *deleted* revisions/pages on the client-side. 
        Previously, these were getting stuck in the queues, as an error 
        prevented their popping/deletion. Now fixed; STiki startup times should 
        improve since clients do not have to (re)-cycle over these revisions.
      # The default queue can now be set dynamically. This way, if a system 
        goes offline, the transition to another queue can be made seamlessly,
        and without requiring end-user intervention.
      # Server-side: Better parsing of external links, including handling 
        plain-text and <ref> tag embedded ones.
      # Server-side: Logic added so CBNG queue does not enqueue CBNG reverts
      # Minor: The StringBuilder() class is now used instead of "+=" over
        immutable Strings. This should bring minor efficiency improvements.
 
  * 2011-03-01:
      # Added the "no watchlist" checkbox to the login panel. In this way,
        settings in account preferences can be overridden, such that
        STiki will never add a page to a user's watchlist.
  
  * 2011-02-24:
      # Transitioned items in the "metadata panel" from JLabels to JTextFields.
        This way, titles/usernames can now be highlighted and copy-pasted.
        Main window cut-copy-paste is problematic due to ZWS insertion, and
        thus it has been disabled (text selection also disabled, for clarity). 
      # rude blocking functionality added to stored procedures. Blocked
        users will only be popped a "special" diff from the server -- which
        tells them are blocked and to discuss at [[Wikipedia_Talk:STiki]].
        Will need dedicated table if blocking ever becomes common.
  
  * 2011-01-31:
      # Better handling of "ignore" functionality: Now, an ignored edit 
        becomes immediately available to others, rather than having a several
        minute "expiration delay" (silly that this wasn't fixed earlier). 
        Also, an issue was fixed where editors would occassionally be 
        re-issued "ignored" edits early in a STiki session. 
      # Additional checks added to ensure that users are only shown edits that
        are "most recent on their article". Now, edits popped are at most
        10-seconds old, with no impact to GUI speed. This should be a 
        substantial improvement for users who classify at slower rates.
      # Added public IRC feeds, hosted at "armstrong.cis.upenn.edu".
        Two channels currently exist: (1) "#arm-stiki-scores", which reports 
        vandalism probabilities, and (2) "#arm-stiki-links", which reports
        link additions (both only to en.wiki and NS0). Formats are self-
        explanatory, and additional feeds can be added if users request them.
      # Better error dialogs when a client cannot connect to backend due to
        (1) no Internet, (2) ports blocked, (3) STiki down, (4) update reqd.
      # Fixed minor typo which broke "contributions" wikilink in edit 
        summaries when making reports to AIV.
  
  * 2010-12-26:
      # QUEUES. Prior to this version, the STiki GUI had only one queue --
        an internal one based on edit metadata. (Note: A queue determines 
        which edits are displayed to a user, based on vandalism probabilities.
        Techniques vary on how one can arrive at a probability). Now, the 
        "Queue" menu offers an explicit choice among several queues. In
        addition to previous "metadata" queue, there are two other options:
        (1) "Cluebot-NG" -- those edits whose score was below the threshold
        required for automatic bot revert (or couldn't be reverted due to 
        1RR or other rules). (2) "WikiTrust" -- based on the reputation 
        system of Adler et al.. This is a significant change, and more 
        information is available in the STiki documentation.
      # Minor changes to AIV reporting. Both reports and comments now have 
        some additional detail to help the admins at AIV.
      # If the 'diff browser' window has focus, the spacebar key will now
        fire the 'scroll down' action, per a feature request @ WP:STiki.
      # Significant changes to communication primitives. All client calls to
        the STiki database are now handled by stored procedures, as a matter
        of security. Frontend GUI users should notice no change as a result.
        All stored procedure calls are logged and can be audited. This
        change will break previous versions of the client.
      # For the backend reputation component (for users and articles), the
        reversions of the recently approved "Cluebot NG" bot are now included.
      # Back-end STiki scores, rather than being on [-inf,inf], now harness
        the logistic nature of ADTree scoring to normalize scores onto [0,1] 
        (making them probability-esque). This transformation maintains relative 
        ordering so frontend users should notice no change. This transform
        was also applied to all historical scorings (API accessible).
        
  * 2010-11-27:
      # Rollback implemented. Rollback [WP:Rollback] is now an option when 
        reverting edits (as opposed to simple "undo"). For users who have
        the "rollback" permission, this is straightforward. For those who
        do not, a more expensive "software rollback" is implemented.
        To this end, a more informative revert-feedback panel now notes both
        the technique used, and the number of edits undone/RB'ed.
      # Per [WP:MINOR], all STiki reverts are now marked as `minor'
      # The "current page" and "page history" links (in the "edit properties"
        panel), now handle special characters in article titles appropriately.
        In particular, this fixes a reported issue with ampersands.
      # User's whose last warning was a "4im" of *any* kind (not just 
        vandalism), will now be reported to AIV if reverted by STiki. The 
        post to AIV will reflect the unique nature of this request.      
      # Minor changes to warning system. IP users will be warned if the
        offending edit occured in the last 24 hours (up from 8 hours, per 
        discussions at [WP:STiki]). Also, reg'd users will now ALWAYS be 
        warned, regardless of detection interval.
      # Offending editors will *not* be reported to AIV if STiki locates
        vandalism that occured *prior* to a user receiving their last warning.
      # Documentation was updated to reflect above changes
  
  * 2010-08-26:
      # Significant changes in the way machine-learning is handled in the
        back-end. An interface now exists to "learning modules" -- allowing
        easy switching between classification strategies. 
      # Leveraging this, a new ML-module was authored, and Alternating-
        Decision Trees (ADTrees) are now the classifier of choice. Off-line
        analysis has shown a huge performance benefit over the previous
        attempts using Support Vector Machines (SVM). (Both modules exist,
        but ADTrees are in active use on the STiki server).
      # ADTrees excel in handling "missing" features. For this reason, we
        now begin processing the edits of *registered* users for vandalism.
        The switch to ADTrees and reg-user-processing began at RID=379406568.
      # One feature was added to the database, "IS_IP", which flags if an edit
        was made anonymously, or not. The "REP_CAT" field was also formally
        dropped from the feature set, it had been in deprecated status.
      # Both the API and documentation were updated as required.
      # Formal version number increased to [1.1].
  
  * 2010-07-17:
      # This version introduces an API (documentation and code in the "/api" 
        directory), which allows developers easy access to STiki vandalism 
        scores and feature sets via a web-interface (HTTP/PHP).
      
  * 2010-06-28:
      #This version introduces the STiki Offline Review Tool (ORT). ORT
        is launched from the "File -> Launch ORT" menu. ORT is a stripped
        down version of STiki that operates over a user-provided list of
        revision IDs. Wikipedia is used only to fetch the associated diffs,
        no editing/reversion options are available. Instead, binary
        classifications are output to a text file. This tool is anticipated
        for use by corpus building researchers. More details are
        available in the STiki documentation. 
  
  * 2010-06-21:
      # Overuse of the "pass" button when the "innocent" button should be 
        used (as recently observed) muddles the edit queue. This is 
        problematic, because a second user (or worse...) now has to waste
        their time sifting through inspected edits, finding no vandalism
        (and for new users, this may affect the adoption rate). Now after
        10 uses of "pass", an informational warning is displayed to the user.
  
  * 2010-06-19:
      # To train the machine-learning classifier (back-end), edits must be 
        labeled as "good" or "vandalism". This can be done by STiki client 
        classifications, but to increase the number of "vandalism" labels -- 
        we also look at rollbacks initiated conventionally, via Huggle, and via
        Twinkle (as these all leave consistent and parse-able edit summaries 
        that identify the vandal and his/her edit). We now add ClueBot to that 
        list. Initially, ClueBot was not included for academic purposes so a 
        "human-verified" set could be claimed. In practice, ClueBot produces
        very few false-positives and should be a helpful addition, especially
        as far as NLP-based features are concerned.
  
  * 2010-06-17:
      # Changes to the scoring of "dirty word" REGEXes on the back-end.
        Previously any occurence of a "dirty word" inside the added-text 
        would be scored as a "hit". Now "hits" which fall along word 
        boundaries are scored at a higher rate than those occuring internal
        to word boundaries. For example, "foo sucks" will receive more
        scoring than "foosucks". We can't expect vandals to have good grammar,
        but this should reduce the penalty of intra-word false-positives. 
  
  * 2010-06-08:
      # Added the "back" button (found in the classification panel), which 
        allows users to revisit the previous edit, under certain criteria: 
        (1) "Back" cannot be used after a reversion, and (2) A user may only go
        "back" a single edit. After the "back" edit is re-classified, the 
        diff-browser will return to the edit being displayed when "back" was 
        pressed. These limitations are generally inconsequential: the feature 
        should prove most helpful when a user has prematurely classified an 
        edit as "innocent" but noticed evidence of "vandalism" after-the-fact.
        Help documentation was also altered to relect this addition.
  
  * 2010-06-05:
      # Added the option to "activate external hyperlinks." The toggle is
        found under the "appearance" menu. When turned on, any external
        link (i.e., text beginning "http://..." will become click-able,
        opening in the user's web browser rather than appearing as plain-text. 
        Some degree of well-formedness is required. Documentation was
        added to the help-doc in accordance with this change.
      # Slight tweaking of warn-criteria (8 hours is now "too old").
      # Several additions to the "dirty regular expressions" list
      # Increased the number of edits used in training (to 25k) and decreased
        training frequency (now every 200k edits), to alleviate "hot-spot"
        issues with poor classifiers over-populating the top of the edit queue.
  
  * 2010-04-08:
      # Added hotkey classification, such that when the classification-button
        panel has focus, simple presses of the 'i', 'p', and 'v' keys are
        sufficient to classify (no ALT+[key] mnemonic required). This enables
        quick classification without mouse usage. Also added documentation
        to the help file making note of this change.
        
  * 2010-04-07:
      # Emergency update: Bringing STiki into compliance with MediaWiki's
        new handling of API login (a poorly coordinated change). Login is
        now a two-phase process, where a token must first be obtained, and
        then accompany a second sending of credentials. Wikimedia states
        this process prevents "CSRF". This version is a required upgrade as
        the change broke all previous STiki versions.    
  
  * 2010-04-02:
      # In response to continued connection timeouts, the [gui_ping_server]
        class was written and now runs in its own thread with the GUI. Most
        connection timeouts had occured after there were 20+ seconds of no 
        interaction; the new class pings the server once every 5 seconds with
        a trivial query in hopes of maintaining the the connection.
      # Nearly every non-visual task the GUI performs is now-THREADED so as
        not to delay the user experience. A pool of threads is created to
        enable this. Every button press (feedback write to the database) is
        assigned to a non-main thread. Most critically, edit metadata/content
        can be pre-fetched and cached in the background via these threads. This
        has its downsides (someone else could make an edit in the meantime,
        invalidating our attempted reversion) -- but the cache size is kept
        relatively small (12 edits) and STiki finds lots of older vandalism, 
        anyways. The [gui_edit_queue] package was created to enable this.
        Should be especially beneficial to those with latent connections.
  
  * 2010-04-01:
      # Some users were reporting problems with broken sockets/dead connections
        leading to hard failures of the GUI. Now, all GUI calls to the DB
        are try-catch wrapped -- and any failure will automatically reset the
        connection -- and then use the new connection to re-attempt the action. 
        Doesn't solve root of problem, but a rather satisfactory outcome
        given the unknown network conditions STiki may operate under.
      
  * 2010-03-31:
      # Changed both the way front-end and back-end applications manage DB
        connections. Each now only uses a single-connection, aside from
        long-running tasks such as training and migration. Little effect in
        the general case; except if under multiple client use -- but on
        the whole a much cleaner coding paradigm.
      # On both the client and the DB server the MySQL-J/Connector
        library was updated from version 3.1.14 to version 5.1.12. It makes
        the client file-size a bit larger, but hopefully this will fix a
        DB/RID-acquisition error some users were experiencing. (there has been
        no recent discussion of the error on MySQL forums).
  
  * 2010-03-30:
      # Added the "last revert panel" to the GUI. This panel reports on the
        success of reversion and describes any warnings issued as a result.
        Intuitive; though it is worth noting that it may take some time for 
        this panel to update (reversion is laggy) -- while the GUI proceeds
        onto the next edit as a result of revert-threading. The HELP files
        were also updated in accordance with this change.
      # Considerable changes to the way several features (byte change, and
        some NLP) are normalized. There will be a temporary performance hit
        as a result, but normalization is now far less static. In the byte
        change case (which has positive and negative values), we normalize
        around 0.5 rather than using absolute value. In the NLP cases, we
        now apply a "integer cap" strategy rather than manually-written ones.
      # New feature added: [NLP_ALPHA], the percentage of text-added in an
        edit which is alpha-characters (not symbols or numbers). Intuitively,
        numeric vandalism seems rare, but edits of this form are common
        (sports), so hopefully this will lead to fewer numeric edits seen.
      # Began data collection of external-link insertions in table
        [hyperlinks]. Perhaps this data can be analyzed over, and certain
        URLs will reveal themselves to be prevalent in vandalism. This
        collection is handled by the new classes [db_hyperlinks.java],
        and [feature_hyperlink.java] (which build on the NLP class).
      # Changed the way "offending regexes" are matched. Should lead to more
        accurate counts, and more efficient searching.
    
  * 2010-03-28:
      # Per the requests of the Wikipedia administration, anonymous/IP
        editing has been disabled (although it can be trivially be compiled
        back in). The help-pages were changed, and a special dialog installed,
        in order to describe this change to end-users.
  
  * 2010-03-26:
      # Further generalization of warning system -- Some "date/year" section
        headings were not being properly recognized, causing STiki to 
        reprint and restart at warning level 1 when unneccessary. Further,
        users will only be reported to AIV if they are not already blocked
        (a check now explicitly made).
      # Added "timestamp" field to the metadata panel on the GUI. This
        describes, in relative terms, how long ago the edit took place
  
  * 2010-03-25: 
      # Repaired NullException in back-end main() loop caused by
        puzzling queue behavior (still not really understood). 
      # Massive overhaul of "warning" of offending editors:
        UserTalk page is parsed to determine existing warnings and determine
        severity of warning issued by STiki. If warnings are exhausted, user
        will be posted to AIV for administrative intervention. Warnings 
        will not be left for edits that occured long ago.
      # Several 'dirty' regexes were added to [feature_language.java].
  
  * 2010-03-22: 
      # Support was added so that offending-users can be 'warned' about their 
        actions. Front-end support was put in place and a checkbox added to
        the GUI. Changes reflected in help documentation. 'Warning' is
        static template usage -- and will need to be made more dynamic. 
      # Several 'dirty' regexes were added to [feature_language.java].

  * 2010-03-21: Initial version of STiki becomes available to the public.
